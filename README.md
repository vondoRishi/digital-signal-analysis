# digital-signal-analysis
 Easy to use java based Digital Signal Analysis software  Fourier Transform is one of the basic tools to analysis a large scale of problems related to time-series analysis. There are very few free open source software which can be use in any platform for Fourier Transform and Power Spectral analysis with simple input and output. This tool can only be used by click of mouse i.e. user need not to learn Matlab or R only for Fourier Transform. Here in this tool Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is implemented with various window function for Power spectrum analysis. I hope this software will help us to learn, understand this basic computational method with simplicity.
